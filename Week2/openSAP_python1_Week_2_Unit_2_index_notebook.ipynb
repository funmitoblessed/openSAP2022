    "The example shows that the item with the index `3` is the fourth item in the list. The reason is that list items are\n",
    "indexed with numbers starting from 0. This is, because programmers and computer scientist start counting with 0, not\n",
    "with 1.\n",
    "(If you want to know why, have a look on the arguments by [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) \n",
    "about the [correct way of using indices](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html).)\n",
    "In the end, this leads to the unpleasant situation, that the fourth item in the list has the index `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the indices start with `0`, indices from `0` to `4` exist in a list with five elements. Additionally, each list in\n",
    "Python has a second index. In this second index items are indexed backwards starting with -1. The following table shows\n",
